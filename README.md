Configuration of my arch system running xfce4 as desktop manager and i3 as window manager 

> __Warning!__ This repository is currently in an early pre-alpha state. It is not easy to install, due to the many dependencies which must be installed.

## Install

First make sure to specify the path of your wallpaper as an environment variable:

```bash
export I3_BACKGROUND=$HOME/wallpapers/desktop_space.jpeg
```

And than run `./install.sh`

## TODO

- [x] Open source
- [ ] Proper install script
    - [ ] auto install dependencies for arch
- [ ] add .vimrc
- [ ] (automate) screenshots of resulting setup
- [ ] add description to readme
- [ ] auto generate documentation of shortcuts
